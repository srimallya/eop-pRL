# Threshold Transformers with End-Only Penalty Progressive Reinforcement Learning for Enhanced Language Modeling

**Abstract**

We present an enhanced language modeling framework that integrates Threshold Transformers, a novel neural architecture with adaptive statistical thresholding, with End-Only Penalty Progressive Reinforcement Learning (EOP-PRL) for test-time scaling. The Threshold Transformer architecture incorporates an Emergent Threshold Layer (ETL) for selective information flow, Thresholded Attention for focusing on salient connections, and a dual-memory integration scheme to improve representation. We introduce a three-stage training process: (1) large-scale pretraining with a Weighted Cross-Entropy (WCE) loss, (2) supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on a smaller dataset using standard Cross-Entropy (CE) loss for next token prediction, and (3) the application of EOP-PRL for adaptive test-time scaling, particularly beneficial for structured reasoning tasks. Theoretically, we demonstrate how the Threshold Transformer's adaptive filtering capabilities provide a strong foundation for the effective application of EOP-PRL, allowing for dynamic adjustments to the model's output at inference time to encourage complete and diverse reasoning paths. This combined approach aims to improve both the efficiency and robustness of language models, particularly for complex tasks requiring structured reasoning.

**1. Introduction**

Transformer architectures have revolutionized natural language processing (NLP), demonstrating remarkable capabilities in modeling long-range dependencies. However, challenges remain in terms of computational efficiency, representation capacity, and the ability to perform complex structured reasoning. Standard transformers process all token interactions uniformly, which can be computationally expensive and may not optimally capture the most relevant information. Furthermore, training language models for reasoning tasks often requires going beyond simple imitation learning.

To address these limitations, we propose a novel framework that combines the strengths of two distinct approaches. First, we leverage the **Threshold Transformer** architecture, which enhances standard transformers through adaptive statistical thresholding across key components. This architecture allows for selective information flow based on learned activation patterns, leading to implicit sparsity and potentially improved efficiency and representation. Key innovations within the Threshold Transformer include the Emergent Threshold Layer (ETL), Thresholded Attention, and a dual-memory architecture.

Second, we introduce a three-stage training process culminating in the application of **End-Only Penalty Progressive Reinforcement Learning (EOP-PRL)** for adaptive test-time scaling. EOP-PRL is a reinforcement learning approach that, instead of penalizing token-level discrepancies, exclusively penalizes incomplete generations. This method is particularly beneficial for structured reasoning tasks where multiple valid reasoning paths might exist. By applying EOP-PRL at test time, we can dynamically encourage the model to generate complete and diverse reasoning paths without the need for further training.

Our three-stage training methodology involves:

1.  **Large-Scale Pretraining:** Training the Threshold Transformer on a massive text corpus using a Weighted Cross-Entropy (WCE) loss function to account for token frequency imbalances and learn general language representations.
2.  **Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT):** Fine-tuning the pretrained model on a smaller, task-specific dataset using standard Cross-Entropy (CE) loss with a next token prediction objective. This stage adapts the model to the specific nuances of the target task.
3.  **End-Only Penalty Progressive Reinforcement Learning (EOP-PRL) for Test-Time Scaling:** Applying EOP-PRL at inference time to further refine the model's output, particularly for tasks requiring structured reasoning. This allows for dynamic adjustments to encourage complete and diverse generations without altering the trained model parameters.

This paper presents the integrated framework, detailing the Threshold Transformer architecture, the principles of EOP-PRL as a test-time scaling method, the three-stage training process, and a theoretical analysis of the combined approach. We demonstrate how the adaptive filtering capabilities of the Threshold Transformer provide a strong foundation for the effective application of EOP-PRL, aiming to improve both the efficiency and robustness of language models, especially for complex reasoning tasks.

**2. Background and Related Work**

**2.1 Standard Transformer Architecture**

The standard transformer architecture (Vaswani et al., 2017) forms the basis of our work and consists of alternating multi-head attention and feed-forward layers. The self-attention mechanism and its multi-head extension are defined as in the previous paper.

**2.2 Sparse and Efficient Transformers**

As discussed previously, several approaches have aimed to improve the efficiency of transformer models, including Sparse Transformers (Child et al., 2019), Reformer (Kitaev et al., 2020), pruning (Michel et al., 2019), and distillation (Sanh et al., 2019). Our Threshold Transformer architecture contributes to this line of work by introducing adaptive thresholding that emerges from training dynamics, offering a flexible and data-driven approach to efficiency.

**2.3 RL for Language Model Fine-tuning and Generation**

Reinforcement Learning has been increasingly used to fine-tune language models for various objectives beyond maximum likelihood estimation, including improving coherence, factuality, and alignment with human preferences [2, 3, 6, 7]. While traditional RL methods often involve token-level rewards, which can be limiting for reasoning tasks, our EOP-PRL approach offers a different perspective by focusing on the completeness of the generated sequence. This is particularly relevant for tasks where multiple valid reasoning paths exist, and the primary goal is to reach a complete and logical conclusion.

**2.4 Curriculum Learning in RL**

Curriculum learning [9] has proven effective in improving the training of complex models. Our use of progressive penalty scaling in EOP-PRL, applied at test time, echoes the principles of curriculum learning by gradually increasing the pressure for completeness.

**3. Threshold Transformer Architecture**

The Threshold Transformer architecture remains as described in the previous paper, incorporating the Improved Emergent Threshold Layer (ETL), Thresholded Attention Mechanism, and a Dual Memory Architecture. The mathematical formulations and Theorem 1 (ETL approximates hard thresholding) and Theorem 2 (Thresholded Attention reduces effective span) remain valid and describe the core components used throughout the three-stage training process. The Dual Memory Architecture and Proposition 1 (two distinct information pathways) also hold.

**4. End-Only Penalty Progressive Reinforcement Learning (EOP-PRL) for Test-Time Scaling**

In our integrated framework, EOP-PRL is not used for direct training of the model's parameters but rather as a mechanism to influence the generation process at test time. After the model has been pretrained and fine-tuned, EOP-PRL can be employed to encourage the generation of complete and potentially diverse reasoning paths, especially for tasks where a reference output sequence $y^*$ with a known length $|y^*|$ is expected.

**4.1 Reward Function for Test-Time Scaling**

At test time, when generating an output sequence $\hat{y}$ of length $|\hat{y}|$ given an input prompt $x$, we can define a pseudo-reward for each generated token $\hat{y}_t$ at position $t$. This reward is not used to update the model's weights but rather to guide the sampling or decoding process (e.g., through techniques like weighted decoding or rejection sampling). The reward function for test-time scaling is adapted from the training reward function:

* **Position-scaled reward for matching tokens (with respect to a potential reference $y^*$):**
    If $\hat{y}_t = y^*_t$, then:
    $$r_t = \alpha \cdot (0.1 + 0.9 \cdot \frac{t}{|\hat{y}|}) \quad (1)$$

* **Zero reward for non-matching tokens:**
    If $\hat{y}_t \neq y^*_t$, then:
    $$r_t = 0 \quad (2)$$

* **End-only penalty for incomplete generations:**
    If $|\hat{y}| < |y^*|$ and the generation process ends (e.g., reaches a maximum length or a specific end-of-sequence token), a final penalty is applied to the last token:
    $$r_{|\hat{y}|-1} += \beta \cdot S_{\text{test}} \cdot \frac{|y^*| - |\hat{y}|}{|y^*|} \quad (3)$$
    Here, $S_{\text{test}}$ represents a pre-defined or dynamically adjusted penalty scaling factor for test time. This scaling factor allows us to control the strength of the preference for complete sequences at inference. It could be a fixed value or adjusted based on the specific task or desired level of completeness.

**4.2 Guiding Generation with EOP-PRL**

The pseudo-rewards calculated using this function can be used to influence the generation process in several ways:

* **Weighted Decoding:** The probability of generating the next token can be weighted by an exponentiated version of the reward received for the previously generated tokens. This encourages the model to favor sequences that receive higher cumulative rewards.
* **Rejection Sampling:** Generated sequences can be sampled from the model, and sequences that receive a sufficiently high cumulative reward (or meet certain criteria based on the reward structure, such as reaching the target length) can be accepted, while others are rejected and the generation process is repeated.
* **Beam Search with Reward Shaping:** The scores of candidate sequences in beam search can be adjusted based on the EOP-PRL reward, guiding the search towards more complete and potentially correct reasoning paths.

The progressive aspect of EOP-PRL, initially designed for training, can be adapted for test time by potentially starting with a lower penalty scaling factor and gradually increasing it over multiple generation attempts or within a single generation process (if the generation can be iteratively refined).

**5. Three-Stage Training Process**

Our approach employs a three-stage training process to optimize the Threshold Transformer for language modeling and prepare it for EOP-PRL-based test-time scaling.

**5.1 Stage 1: Large-Scale Pretraining**

* **Dataset:** A large, general-purpose text corpus (e.g., Common Crawl, Wikipedia).
* **Objective:** Next token prediction.
* **Loss Function:** Weighted Cross-Entropy (WCE) loss as defined previously:
    $$\mathcal{L}_{\text{WCE}}(y, \hat{y}) = -\sum_i w_i y_i \log(\hat{y}_i)$$
    The token weights $w_i$ are calculated based on the frequency of each token in the pretraining corpus, giving more weight to less frequent tokens to improve their representations.

**5.2 Stage 2: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)**

* **Dataset:** A smaller, task-specific dataset relevant to the intended application (e.g., a dataset of structured reasoning problems with corresponding solution paths).
* **Objective:** Next token prediction.
* **Loss Function:** Standard Cross-Entropy (CE) loss:
    $$\mathcal{L}_{\text{CE}}(y, \hat{y}) = -\sum_i y_i \log(\hat{y}_i)$$
    For SFT on a smaller dataset, standard CE loss is often sufficient and can yield better performance by focusing on the specific patterns in the target data.

**5.3 Stage 3: End-Only Penalty Progressive Reinforcement Learning (EOP-PRL) for Test-Time Scaling**

* **Dataset:** Not used for training in this stage.
* **Objective:** Encourage complete and diverse reasoning paths at inference time.
* **Method:** Apply the EOP-PRL reward function as a guide for the generation process using techniques like weighted decoding, rejection sampling, or beam search with reward shaping. The penalty scaling factor $S_{\text{test}}$ can be adjusted based on the desired stringency for completeness.

**6. Theoretical Analysis of the Integrated Framework**

**6.1 Synergy between Threshold Transformers and EOP-PRL**

The Threshold Transformer architecture, with its adaptive filtering capabilities, provides a strong foundation for the effective application of EOP-PRL at test time. The ETL allows the model to focus on statistically significant information, potentially leading to more coherent and relevant intermediate steps in the reasoning process. The Thresholded Attention mechanism can help the model focus on key semantic connections, which is crucial for maintaining logical flow in structured reasoning.

**Theorem 5:** The adaptive sparsity induced by the Threshold Transformer architecture can enhance the effectiveness of EOP-PRL by promoting the exploration of diverse and potentially more efficient reasoning paths during test-time scaling.

**Proof (Sketch):** The Threshold Transformer's ability to selectively filter less important information allows the model to maintain a more focused representation of the input and the generated sequence so far. This reduced noise in the internal representations can make the model more sensitive to the subtle signals provided by the EOP-PRL reward. For instance, when exploring alternative reasoning steps (which might initially lead to non-matching tokens and zero reward), the Threshold Transformer's architecture might be better at preserving the relevant context needed to eventually reach a complete and correct solution, making the exploration encouraged by EOP-PRL more fruitful. The sparsity in attention can also lead to more focused processing of relevant information, potentially making the model more efficient in exploring different reasoning branches guided by the EOP-PRL reward. □

**6.2 Computational Efficiency and Representational Power**

The theoretical benefits of the Threshold Transformer architecture in terms of computational efficiency (Proposition 2) and representational power (Theorem 4) remain relevant in this integrated framework. These properties contribute to the overall performance of the model before the application of EOP-PRL at test time. EOP-PRL then further refines the generation process without adding to the training complexity of the underlying model.

**7. Implementation Details**

The implementation details for the Threshold Transformer architecture (hyperparameters and Algorithm 1) remain as described previously. For the three-stage training process:

* **Pretraining:** Implemented using standard deep learning frameworks with optimized WCE loss calculation.
* **SFT:** Implemented using standard deep learning frameworks with CE loss for next token prediction.
* **EOP-PRL for Test-Time Scaling:** Requires implementing the reward function and integrating it with the chosen decoding or sampling strategy. The penalty scaling factor $S_{\text{test}}$ needs to be carefully chosen based on the task and desired outcome.

**8. Discussion and Implications**

The integration of Threshold Transformers with EOP-PRL for test-time scaling offers a powerful approach to enhancing language models, particularly for tasks requiring structured reasoning. The three-stage training process allows us to leverage large-scale unsupervised data for general representation learning, adapt the model to specific tasks through supervised fine-tuning, and then further refine the output at inference time using reinforcement learning principles to encourage completeness and diversity.

The adaptive thresholding in the Threshold Transformer architecture provides a strong foundation for this approach by allowing the model to focus on relevant information and potentially explore more efficiently under the guidance of the EOP-PRL reward. The separation of concerns – training the model with standard objectives and then using RL principles for test-time output refinement – can be advantageous in terms of stability and control over the generation process.

**9. Conclusion**

We have presented an integrated framework combining Threshold Transformers with End-Only Penalty Progressive Reinforcement Learning for test-time scaling, along with a three-stage training process. The Threshold Transformer architecture provides adaptive filtering and enhanced representational power, while EOP-PRL, applied at inference, encourages the generation of complete and diverse reasoning paths. This combined approach aims to improve both the efficiency and robustness of language models, particularly for complex structured reasoning tasks. Future work will focus on empirical evaluation of this framework on various reasoning benchmarks and exploring different strategies for applying EOP-PRL at test time.
